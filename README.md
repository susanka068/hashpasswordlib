# hashpasswordlib
This python code block hashes a password and can check for the same vice versa.

To get the hashed password, call the function and insert your password string into it. And to check for the same vice versa there is another func as well.
This algo can actually be used in a real time login/signup system obviously with further tweaking, looking forward to making a module of the same, obviously with further tweaking and unique changes.
